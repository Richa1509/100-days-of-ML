# ðŸ§  100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to the **10 Days of Machine Learning** challenge! This repository contains a day-by-day breakdown of fundamental machine learning concepts and hands-on implementation using Python and popular ML libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## ðŸ“… Overview

Each day introduces a key ML concept followed by a practical notebook or script to apply what you've learned.
